Follow PEP 8 Python coding standards
Use 4 spaces for indentation, not tabs
Use snake_case for functions, methods, and variables
Use CamelCase for classes

Git Workflow

Create feature branches from main branch with format feature/feature-name
Use format fix/bug-description for bug fix branches
Commit messages should include prefixes [FEATURE], [FIX], or [DOCS]
All commits should be merged to the build branch, not main or master
Pull requests must include change descriptions and test results
