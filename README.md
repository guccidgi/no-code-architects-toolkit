# No-Code Architects Toolkit by Stephen G. Pope

Tired of wasting thousands of dollars on API subscriptions to support all your automations? What if there was a free alternative?

The No-Code Architects Toolkit API processes different types of media. It is built in Python using Flask.

The API can convert audio files. It can manipulate video files. It creates transcriptions of content. It translates content between languages. It adds captions to videos.

The API manages files across multiple cloud services like Google Drive, Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Dropbox. You can deploy this toolkit in several ways. It works with Docker. It runs on Google Cloud Platform. It functions on Digital Ocean. You can use it with any system that hosts Docker.

Easily replace services like ChatGPT Whisper, Cloud Convert, Createomate, JSON2Video, PDF(dot)co, Placid and OCodeKit.

## Docker Build and Run

1. **Build the Docker Image**:

   ```bash
   docker build -t no-code-architects-toolkit .
   ```

The following environment variables are necessary for the application to function as intended:

- `API_KEY`: A secure API key for authenticating requests.
- `GCP_SA_CREDENTIALS`: Service account credentials in JSON format for Google Cloud Platform access.
- `GCP_BUCKET_NAME`: The name of the Google Cloud Storage bucket used for storage.

2. **Run the Docker Container**:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8080:8080 \
     -e API_KEY=your_api_key \
     -e GCP_SA_CREDENTIALS='{"your":"service_account_json"}' \
     -e GCP_BUCKET_NAME=your_gcs_bucket_name \
     no-code-architects-toolkit
   ```

# **Installing the NCA Toolkit API on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**

## ðŸŽ¥ Video Installation Instructions

Watch these **[Detailed Video Instructions](https://youtu.be/6bC93sek9v8)** to set up the No-Code Architects Toolkit API.

- **Docker Image**: stephengpope/no-code-architects-toolkit:latest

### Mentioned Resources

- **[Postman Template](https://bit.ly/49Gkh61)**
- **[NCA Toolkit API GPT](https://bit.ly/4feDDk4)** 

Or use the guide below walks you through the steps to install the NCA Toolkit API on GCP.

---

## **Prerequisites**
- A Google Cloud account. [Sign up here](https://cloud.google.com/) if you donâ€™t already have one.
  - New users receive $300 in free credits.
- Basic knowledge of GCP services such as Cloud Run and Cloud Storage.
- A terminal or code editor for managing files.

---

## **Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project**
1. Log into the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Click on the **Project Selector** in the top navigation bar and select **New Project**.
3. Enter a project name, such as `NCA Toolkit Project`.
4. Click **Create**.

---

## **Step 2: Enable Required APIs**
Enable the following APIs:
- **Cloud Storage API**
- **Cloud Storage JSON API**
- **Cloud Run API**

### **How to Enable APIs:**
1. In the GCP Console, navigate to **APIs & Services** > **Enable APIs and Services**.
2. Search for each API, click on it, and enable it.

---

## **Step 3: Create a Service Account**
1. Navigate to **IAM & Admin** > **Service Accounts** in the GCP Console.
2. Click **+ Create Service Account**.
   - Enter a name (e.g., `NCA Toolkit Service Account`).
3. Assign the following roles to the service account:
   - **Storage Admin**
   - **Viewer**
4. Click **Done** to create the service account.
5. Open the service account details and navigate to the **Keys** tab.
   - Click **Add Key** > **Create New Key**.
   - Choose **JSON** format, download the file, and store it securely.

---

## **Step 4: Create a Cloud Storage Bucket**
1. Navigate to **Storage** > **Buckets** in the GCP Console.
2. Click **+ Create Bucket**.
   - Choose a unique bucket name (e.g., `nca-toolkit-bucket`).
   - Leave default settings, but:
     - Uncheck **Enforce public access prevention**.
     - Set **Access Control** to **Uniform**.
3. Click **Create** to finish.
4. Go to the bucket permissions, and add **allUsers** as a principal with the role:
   - **Storage Object Viewer**.
5. Save changes.

---

## **Step 5: Deploy the Toolkit on Cloud Run**
1. Navigate to **Cloud Run** in the GCP Console.
2. Click **Create Service** and configure the deployment:
   - **Container Image URL**: Use the toolkit's Docker Hub image URL (refer to the GitHub repository).
   - **Allow unauthenticated invocations**.
   - **CPU Allocation**: Set to **Always Allocated**.
   - **Memory and CPU**: Allocate **16 GB memory** and **4 CPUs**.

3. Under **Variables & Secrets**, set the following environment variables:
   - `API_KEY`: Set a secure key (e.g., `Test123`).
   - `GCP_BUCKET_NAME`: Your Cloud Storage bucket name (e.g., `nca-toolkit-bucket`).
   - `GCP_SA_CREDENTIALS`: Paste the contents of the JSON file downloaded in **Step 3**.

4. Save the settings and deploy the service.

---

## **Step 6: Test the Deployment**

1. Install **[Postman Template](https://bit.ly/49Gkh61)** on your computer.
2. Import the API example requests from the NCA Toolkit GitHub repository.
3. Configure two environment variables in Postman:
   - `base_url`: Your deployed Cloud Run service URL.
   - `x-api-key`: The API key you configured in **Step 5**.
4. Use the example requests to validate that the API is functioning correctly.
5. Use the **[NCA Toolkit API GPT](https://bit.ly/4feDDk4)** to learn more.

By following these steps, your NCA Toolkit API should be successfully deployed on Google Cloud Platform.
